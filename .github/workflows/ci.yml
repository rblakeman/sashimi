# A job is a set of steps that execute on the same runner.
# The jobs can be run in parallel or sequentially and can
# have many steps.
# In this case, I created a single job with many steps
# since the configuration is pretty simple but
# I could have created a different structure using parallel jobs.
# Each job uses an own runner.
jobs:
  # Job name
  suite:
    # OS of the runner
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # A step is an individual task that can run commands in a job
    # and share the same runner.
    # Each step can run a ready-to-use action or a bash command
